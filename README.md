# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

## Objective
Contact tracing has been a pillar of communicable disease control in public health for decades. However, we  continue to have large scale challenges in achieving the goals of contact tracing during such chaotic events. Development of better guidelines and strategies for pandemic contact tracing continues. COVID-19 has brought an unprecedented challenge for all of us. Leveraging technology can help us contain community transmission and channelize our efforts to the high-risk areas.

## Goals
Singapore and South Korea have shown us the effectiveness of the contact tracing model in reducing community transmutation by actively tracking infected people and sending alertness to the suspect cases for early intervention, so that necessary quarantine and treatment can be proactively done.

Itrac is a contact tracing app, which aims to meet the following goals to help fight the COVID-19 pandemic:

### Self Protection - 
This app keeps a track of your “close contact meetings” and alerts you if there is a possibility of infection within your network. This enables you to realize the risk early so that you can self-quarantine yourself and take required medical support.

### Site Alertness - 
Public places like buses, rail compartments, department stores,office buildings and apartment complex etc are high risk areas where community transmission happens. Itrac can be used to track if any infected person has visited these public areas and hence alert all the visitors and quarantine the public location till it is sanitised.

### Community Protection - 
Itrac can be used to trace community level data at a national, state, city, and locality level, and can provide inputs to government (optional)and health department authorities (optional)to focus on high risk areas. 

## Solution
Itrac is a collaboration app, which use inputs from it’s registered community and diagnostics centers to prevent com-munity transmission of COVID-19

-	It uses multiple channels such as QR scanning, SMS, and Bluetooth to register any meeting between individuals or their visits to public places. This voluntary exercise and participation of users is the key to make the tracing program effective.

-	It uses GPS location and Maps data to track the location of users and allows effective tracking of infected clusters.

-	It will provide users with self-report if diagnosed positive. This will be validated by the Diagnostic centre before alerts are shared in the network. This validation is critical to avoid sending panic in the community.

-	It doesn’t share any personal user data with the connected network, safeguarding your privacy and ensuring you have control over your data.

-	As an additional privacy measure, the users can report their meetings in incognito mode. So while the meeting would not appear on the user's timeline, the system will know and alert the users of the risk, if the need be.
-	A report of the high risk cases with contact numbers of the individuals can be generated and shared with the au-thorities on a regular basis. 

## Current Status:-
Itrac app is live in version beta-v0.1, with the QR feature and other essential features enabled. SMS and Bluetooth tracking will be included in the next version, which can be released within a week. 

Following is a visual walkthrough of the app:– 

 	



On the landing screen, the Users will be able to quickly track how many people they have met today and they ll be able to add their new meetings to the app by tapping “Add people”.



The users will also be able to track the risk of being COVID-19 positive. They will be able to add to the app if they see any symptoms of illness, and the app will accordingly update the COVID-19 Risk Quotient.
 	



On the landing screen itself, as the user scrolls down, they will get a quick view of their recent meetings and the color (green in this screen) will highlight their respective COVID-19 Risk Quotient.




Users will also get a quick glimpse of the COVID-19 cases in their vicinity.
	
 	



In the “timeline” view, the user would be able to track the past meetings






User would also be able to track the COVID-19 Risk Quotient of each of the 1st degree connections, in the timeline view
 	






On the “updates” screen, the user will be able to track the details of reported cases in their vicinity. 





Users will also be able to browse through the information shared by authorities, WHO, and other health bodies, that will help create awareness.
   

### Support Required
-	Tie-ups with all the approved diagnostic centers to help validate the positive cases using a unique ID.

-	Create awareness on the benefits of contract tracing among citizens using various outreach channels.
